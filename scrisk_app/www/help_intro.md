# 👋 Welcome to scRiskDB

**scRiskDB** is a comprehensive databsase platform designed to interpret polygenic disease risks using single-cell data.

#### Key Features:

-   **Prioritized Annotation**: Connects GWAS SNPs to candidate **Risk Genes** and **cis-Regulatory Elements (CREs)** in specific tissue/cell-type contexts.

-   **Functional Insight**: Uncovers disease-enriched **Pathways** (GO terms) and highlights **Critical Cell Types** that drive disease susceptibility.

-   **Multi-dimensional Validation**: Integrated with **Open Targets/LDexpress** (for genes) and **3D Genome Browser** (for CREs) to provide causal evidence.

-   **Custom Analysis**: Upload your own single-cell data (RNA or ATAC) to calculate disease enrichment scores.
